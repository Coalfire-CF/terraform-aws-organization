## ACE AWS Organizations Module

## Dependencies

List any dependencies here. E.g. security-core, region-setup

## Resource List

Insert a high-level list of resources created as a part of this module. E.g.

- Storage Account
- Containers
- Storage share
- Lifecycle policy
- CMK key and Iam Role Assignment
- Monitor diagnostic setting

## Code Updates

If applicable, add here. For example, updating variables, updating `tstate.tf`, or remote data sources.

`tstate.tf` Update to the appropriate version and storage accounts, see sample

``` hcl
terraform {
  required_version = "~>1.5.0"
  backend "s3" {
    profile        = "mgmt-prod"
    bucket         = "prod-us-gov-west-1-tf-state"
    region         = "us-gov-west-1"
    key            = "prod-us-gov-west-1-aws-org.tfstate"
    dynamodb_table = "prod-us-gov-west-1-state-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

Change directory to the `active-directory` folder

Run `terraform init` to download modules and create initial local state file.

Run `terraform plan` to ensure no errors and validate plan is deploying expected resources.

Run `terraform apply` to deploy infrastructure.

Update the `remote-data.tf` file to add the security state key

``` hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "network-mgmt" {
  backend   = "s3"
  workspace = "default"

  config = {
    bucket  = "${var.resource_prefix}-${var.aws_region}-fr-tf-state"
    region  = var.aws_region
    key     = "prod-us-gov-west-1-aws-org.tfstate"
    profile = "mgmt-prod"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Steps

This module can be called as outlined below.

- Change directories to the `reponame` directory.
- From the `terraform/aws/reponame` directory run `terraform init`.
- Run `terraform plan` to review the resources being created.
- If everything looks correct in the plan output, run `terraform apply`.

## Usage

Include example for how to call the module below with generic variables

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "aws_org" {
  source                    = "github.com/Coalfire-CF/ACE-Azure-StorageAccount?ref=vX.X.X"
  service_access_principals = [
    "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com",
    "config.amazonaws.com",
  ]
  feature_set = "ALL"
  aws_new_member_account_email = "example@email.com"
  aws_new_member_account_name = "aws_account_12345"
  }
```
